## Application Version Manager

Simple and flexible utility via pure JavaScript to work with client application cache. 

## Using

1. `cd version-manager`.
2. `node generator.js` file (or just execute `build.bat`).
3. Include **version-manager** directory into your project. `version-manager/main.js` should be the first.
4. Every time after new build version generated, all internal settings will reset and specified to new one.
